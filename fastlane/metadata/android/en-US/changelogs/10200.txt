Version 1.2.0 – 2025-08-29

New
- JPEG export in addition to PDF
- Optional enhancement: AUTO (contrast/sharpen) or Black & White (text)
- Save via SAF with custom destination and filename DOC_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.jpg

Improvements
- Memory protection for very large images
- Stability improvements in image processing (OpenCV)
- Edge-to-edge UI updated for Android 15 (androidx.activity EdgeToEdge)
- OCR screen: bottom action button above navigation bar on Android 10, placed lower for reachability
- Build & maintenance: removed deprecated memory trim constants, surfaced deprecation warnings, added 16 KB page-size verification script for native libs

Fixes
- Various minor bug fixes and UI polish for export and sharing
- Improved readability in dark mode: low-light warning dialog buttons now use high-contrast text color

Notes
- AUTO = histogram equalization + unsharp mask
- Black & White (Text) = robust binarization for readability
- Native libraries rebuilt with 16 KB page size (-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384) → compliance, no functional changes
