1.5.2 (Release)

- Improved reliability of OCR status updates by modernizing in‑app broadcasts (no LocalBroadcastManager; uses up‑to‑date APIs)
- Stability: replaced deprecated list position APIs to ensure smoother page ordering and interactions on newer devices
- Bump library versions: AGP to 8.11.2, JUnit to 1.3.0, Espresso Core to 3.7.0, Material to 1.13.0, and others.

- JPEG export: fixed orientation handling so rotated scans are exported with the correct rotation (consistent with PDF export)
- Preview: when "Export as JPEG" is selected, the PDF-only option "Convert B/W" is ignored; only JPEG options affect the preview
