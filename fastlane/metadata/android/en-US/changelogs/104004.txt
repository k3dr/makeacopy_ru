MakeACopy 1.4.0

What’s new
- New: Import an existing image via the system file picker (SAF). Process it through the same Review → Crop → Export flow as camera captures.

Notes
- No additional permissions required for importing (SAF). Read access is persisted only when granted by the system.

Additional changes in 1.4.0
- Fixed: Cropped images no longer look stretched; perspective correction now preserves the selection’s aspect ratio.
