1.5.1 (Release Candidate)

- New: rotate **after crop, before OCR** (±90°, 180°) per page
- Completed Scans: **Select all / Deselect all** and **Delete**
- Safer OCR: single-thread, one TessBaseAPI per job; cooperative cancel → fixes rare Tesseract/Leptonica crashes
- More robust inputs (immutable ARGB_8888, A4 scaling) and a clearer **Process → Processing… → Next** flow
- Many small fixes and better error messages
- Device-specific: fix black preview on HONOR Magic UI 4 (Android 10) by forcing TextureView.

Note: This is an RC build; feedback is welcome to improve stability and polish.
