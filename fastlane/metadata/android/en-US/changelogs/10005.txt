Native OpenCV build improvements

* Uses a fixed build timestamp (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH) to improve build comparison
* Switches to single-threaded compilation to reduce non-determinism
* Avoids path dependencies using compiler flags like -fdebug-prefix-map
* Enforces clean builds per architecture (removes old CMake cache)
* Excludes unused OpenCV modules for smaller native libraries

ðŸ’¡ Goal: More consistent native builds â€“ a step towards reproducibility
