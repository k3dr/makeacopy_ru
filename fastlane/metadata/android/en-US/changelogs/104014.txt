MakeACopy 1.4.1

- Fix: Misaligned OCR text layer in macOS Preview resolved (text now uses the same transform as the image).

- PDF: Embedded Unicode font (Noto Sans) for the OCR layer to ensure stable text metrics.

- OCR: More robust RecognizedWord handling — normalized & clamped bounding boxes, defensive copies, consistent transforms; more stable line clustering and text selection.

- Export: JpegExporter—improved compression in BW_TEXT mode and faster/cleaner preprocessing via morphology filters (opening/closing) → fewer artifacts, smaller files.
