* Uses a fixed build timestamp via SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to improve build reproducibility
* Switches to single-threaded compilation (make -j1) to reduce non-determinism
* Avoids absolute path dependencies using compiler flags like -fdebug-prefix-map and -ffile-prefix-map
* Strips debug symbols and build IDs (llvm-strip) to eliminate binary noise
* Enforces clean builds per ABI by removing old CMake cache and output directories
* Excludes unused OpenCV modules for smaller and faster .so output
* Automatically detects the latest installed NDK and CMake (fallback via ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and which)
* Issues warnings for non-recommended NDK versions to guide consistent builds
* Adds Gradle Kotlin workaround: sets kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = 17 in build.gradle when needed
* Prepares for multi-architecture output (e.g., x86, x86_64, riscv64) with clean separation per ABI
* Improved logging and error handling (e.g., trap, tail of log on failure, log path output)

ðŸ’¡ Goal: Achieve smaller, consistent and reproducible native builds â€“ a solid step toward leaner APKs and F-Droid compliance.
