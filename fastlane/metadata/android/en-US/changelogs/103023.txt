Version 1.3.1 â€“ 2025-09-09

Fixes
- Reliable image previews on some Huawei/Honor devices (Android 10): the app now decodes captured photos from the file path first for internal previews (Review/Crop/Export) and uses FileProvider URIs only for sharing.

Improvements
- Added a small wait in the camera pipeline to ensure the saved file is finalized before rendering.
- Centralized image decoding via a new ImageLoader with downsampling and EXIF rotation.
- Hardened FileProvider configuration to app-specific external files only.
- Cache cleanup now also covers the external cache directory.

Notes
- Base versionCode: 10301
- ABI: x86 (103013)
